- Consistent across different dataset sizes
- Moderate computational requirements

**TabMinHash:**
- Stable performance characteristics
- Lower re-identification rates
- Efficient runtime performance

### 2. Critical Privacy Insights

**Overlap Impact:**
- Non-linear relationship between overlap and privacy risk
- 40% overlap threshold for reasonable privacy protection
- Encoding-dependent sensitivity patterns

**Dataset Size Effects:**
- Larger datasets provide some privacy protection (dilution effect)
- Computational costs scale super-linearly
- Hyperparameter optimization is the primary bottleneck

**Configuration Dependencies:**
- Model complexity significantly impacts both performance and privacy
- Drop strategy choice affects attack success rates
- Training dataset size influences generalization

### 3. Predictive Model Insights

**Most Important Factors for Re-identification Success:**
1. Data overlap percentage (highest impact)
2. Encoding scheme choice
3. Model complexity (layers × hidden size)
4. Training dataset size

**Most Important Factors for F1 Performance:**
1. Hyperparameter configuration
2. Training epochs
3. Model architecture
4. Dataset characteristics

### 4. Cluster Analysis Results

Four distinct experimental patterns identified:
1. **High-Performance, Low-Risk** (optimal scenarios)
2. **High-Performance, High-Risk** (effective but dangerous)
3. **Low-Performance, Low-Risk** (safe but ineffective)
4. **Low-Performance, High-Risk** (worst-case scenarios)
